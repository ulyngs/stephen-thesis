# you can be lazy and just let bookdown search for the .Rmd files to merge into your thesis
# for this to work, make sure to start any acknowledgements and/or abstract Rmd files with 
# an underscore, e.g. _abstract.Rmd. Otherwise bookdown will start to merge the abstract 
# in to the body text which almost certainly isn't what you want

#alternatively you can comment out rmd_subdir and specify manually what files to include
rmd_files: ["index.Rmd", "text/01-introduction.Rmd"]
