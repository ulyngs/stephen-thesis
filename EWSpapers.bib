abstract = {Background: Delayed response to clinical deterioration of ward patients is common. Methods: We performed a prospective before-and-after study in all patients admitted to two clinical ward areas in a district general hospital in the UK. We examined the effect on clinical outcomes of deploying an electronic automated advisory vital signs monitoring and notification system, which relayed abnormal vital signs to a rapid response team (RRT). Results: We studied 2139 patients before (control) and 2263 after the intervention. During the intervention the number of RRT notifications increased from 405 to 524 (p = 0.001) with more notifications triggering fluid therapy, bronchodilators and antibiotics. Moreover, despite an increase in the number of patients with "do not attempt resuscitation" orders (from 99 to 135; p = 0.047), mortality decreased from 173 to 147 (p = 0.042) patients and cardiac arrests decreased from 14 to 2 events (p = 0.002). Finally, the severity of illness in patients admitted to the ICU was reduced (mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score: 26 (SD 9) vs. 18 (SD 8)), as was their mortality (from 45{\%} to 24{\%}; p = 0.04). Conclusions: Deployment of an electronic automated advisory vital signs monitoring and notification system to signal clinical deterioration in ward patients was associated with significant improvements in key patient-centered clinical outcomes.

abstract = {Background: Early warning scores (EWS) have been developed as clinical prognostication tools to identify acutely deteriorating patients. In the past few years, there has been a proliferation of studies that describe the development and validation of novel machine learning-based EWS. Systematic reviews of published studies which focus on evaluating performance of both well-established and novel EWS have shown conflicting conclusions. A possible reason is the heterogeneity in validation methods applied. In this review, we aim to examine the methodologies and metrics used in studies which perform EWS validation. Methods: A systematic review of all eligible studies from the MEDLINE database and other sources, was performed. Studies were eligible if they performed validation on at least one EWS and reported associations between EWS scores and inpatient mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) transfers, or cardiac arrest (CA) of adults. Two reviewers independently did a full-text review and performed data abstraction by using standardized data-worksheet based on the TRIPOD (Transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) checklist. Meta-analysis was not performed due to heterogeneity. Results: The key differences in validation methodologies identified were (1) validation dataset used, (2) outcomes of interest, (3) case definition, time of EWS use and aggregation methods, and (4) handling of missing values. In terms of case definition, among the 48 eligible studies, 34 used the patient episode case definition while 12 used the observation set case definition, and 2 did the validation using both case definitions. Of those that used the patient episode case definition, 18 studies validated the EWS at a single point of time, mostly using the first recorded observation. The review also found more than 10 different performance metrics reported among the studies. Conclusions: Methodologies and performance metrics used in studies performing validation on EWS were heterogeneous hence making it difficult to interpret and compare EWS performance. Standardizing EWS validation methodology and reporting can potentially address this issue.},

abstract = {Doctors have little specific research to draw on when predicting outcome. In this first article in a series Karel Moons and colleagues explain why research into prognosis is important and how to design such research

Hippocrates included prognosis as a principal concept of medicine.1 Nevertheless, principles and methods of prognostic research have received limited attention, especially compared with therapeutic and aetiological research. This article is the first in a series of four aiming to provide an accessible overview of these principles and methods. Our focus is on prognostic studies aimed at predicting outcomes from multiple variables rather than on studies investigating whether a single variable (such as a tumour or other biomarker) may be prognostic. Here we consider the principles of prognosis and multivariable prognostic studies and the reasons for and settings in which multivariable prognostic models are developed and used. The other articles in the series will focus on the development of multivariable prognostic models,2 their validation,3 and the application and impact of prognostic models in practice.4

{\#}{\#}{\#}{\#} Summary points 

Prognosis simply means foreseeing, predicting, or estimating the probability or risk of future conditions; familiar examples are weather and economic forecasts. In medicine, prognosis commonly relates to the probability or risk of an individual developing a particular state of health (an outcome) over a specific time, based on his or her clinical and non-clinical profile. Outcomes are often specific events, such as death or complications, but they may also be quantities, such as disease progression, (changes in) pain, or quality of {\ldots}},

The package implements a new expectation-maximization with bootstrapping algorithm that works faster, with larger numbers of variables, and is far easier to use, than various Markov chain Monte Carlo approaches, but gives essentially the same answers. The program also improves imputation models by allowing researchers to put Bayesian priors on individual cell values, thereby including a great deal of potentially valuable and extensive information. It also includes features to accurately impute cross-sectional datasets, individual time series, or sets of time series for different cross-sections. A full set of graphical diagnostics are also available. The program is easy to use, and the simplicity of the algorithm makes it far more robust; both a simple command line and extensive graphical user interface are included.},

abstract = {After the diagnosis of a disease, one major objective is to predict cumulative probabilities of events such as clinical relapse or death from the individual information collected up to a prediction time, usually including biomarker repeated measurements. Several competing estimators have been proposed, mainly from two approaches: joint modelling and landmarking. These approaches differ by the information used, the model assumptions and the complexity of the computational procedures. This paper aims to review the two approaches, precisely define the derived estimators of dynamic predictions and compare their performances notably in case of misspecification. The ultimate goal is to provide key elements for the use of individual dynamic predictions in clinical practice. Prediction of two competing causes of prostate cancer progression from the history of prostate-specific antigen is used as a motivated example. We formally define the quantity to estimate and its estimators, propose techniques to assess the uncertainty around predictions and validate them. We then conduct an in-depth simulation study compare the estimators in terms of prediction error, discriminatory power, efficiency and robustness to model assumptions. We show that prediction tools should be handled with care, in particular by properly specifying models and estimators.},

We provide a formal definition of the estimands matching these questions, give examples of settings in which each is useful and discuss appropriate estimators including their assumptions.

abstract = {Objectives To compare different methods to handle treatment when developing a prognostic model that aims to produce accurate probabilities of the outcome of individuals if left untreated. Study Design and Setting Simulations were performed based on two normally distributed predictors, a binary outcome, and a binary treatment, mimicking a randomized trial or an observational study. Comparison was made between simply ignoring treatment (SIT), restricting the analytical data set to untreated individuals (AUT), inverse probability weighting (IPW), and explicit modeling of treatment (MT). Methods were compared in terms of predictive performance of the model and the proportion of incorrect treatment decisions. Results Omitting a genuine predictor of the outcome from the prognostic model decreased model performance, in both an observational study and a randomized trial. In randomized trials, the proportion of incorrect treatment decisions was smaller when applying AUT or MT, compared to SIT and IPW. In observational studies, MT was superior to all other methods regarding the proportion of incorrect treatment decisions. Conclusion If a prognostic model aims to produce correct probabilities of the outcome in the absence of treatment, ignoring treatments that affect that outcome can lead to suboptimal model performance and incorrect treatment decisions. Explicitly, modeling treatment is recommended.},

abstract = {Objective: To determine whether the introduction of an intensive care unit-based medical emergency team, responding to hospital-wide preset criteria of physiologic instability, would decrease the rate of predefined adverse outcomes in patients having major surgery. Design: Prospective, controlled before-and-after trial. Setting: University-affiliated hospital. Patients: Consecutive patients admitted to hospital for major surgery during a 4-month control phase and during a 4-month intervention phase. Interventions: Introduction of a hospital-wide intensive care unit-based medical emergency team to evaluate and treat inpatients deemed at risk of developing an adverse outcome by nursing, paramedical, and/or medical staff. Measurements and Main Results: We measured incidence of serious adverse events, mortality after major surgery, and mean duration of hospital stay. There were 1,369 operations in 1,116 patients during the control period and 1,313 in 1,067 patients during the medical emergency team intervention period. In the control period, there were 336 adverse outcomes in 190 patients (301 outcomes/1,000 surgical admissions), which decreased to 136 in 105 patients (127 outcomes/1,000 surgical admissions) during the intervention period (relative risk reduction, 57.8{\%}; p {\textless} .0001). These changes were due to significant decreases in the number of cases of respiratory failure (relative risk reduction, 79.1{\%}; p {\textless} .0001), stroke (relative risk reduction, 78.2{\%}; p = .0026), severe sepsis (relative risk reduction, 74.3{\%}; p = .0044), and acute renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy (relative risk reduction, 88.5{\%}; p {\textless} .0001). Emergency intensive care unit admissions were also reduced (relative risk reduction, 44.4{\%}; p = .001). The introduction of the medical emergency team was also associated with a significant decrease in the number of postoperative deaths (relative risk reduction, 36.6{\%}; p = .0178). Duration of hospital stay after major surgery decreased from a mean of 23.8 days to 19.8 days (p = .0092). Conclusions: The introduction of an intensive care unit-based medical emergency team in a teaching hospital was associated with a reduced incidence of postoperative adverse outcomes, postoperative mortality rate, and mean duration of hospital stay.},

abstract = {Background. Diagnostic and prognostic models are typically evaluated with measures of accuracy that do not address clinical consequences. Decision-analytic techniques allow assessment of clinical outcomes but often require collection of additional information and may be cumbersome to apply to models that yield a continuous result. The authors sought a method for evaluating and comparing prediction models that incorporates clinical consequences, requires only the data set on which the models are tested, and can be applied to models that have either continuous or dichotomous results. Method. The authors describe decision curve analysis, a simple, novel method of evaluating predictive models. They start by assuming that the threshold probability of a disease or event at which a patient would opt for treatment is informative of how the patient weighs the relative harms of a false-positive and a false-negative prediction. This theoretical relationship is then used to derive the net benefit of the model across different threshold probabilities. Plotting net benefit against threshold probability yields the "decision curve." The authors apply the method to models for the prediction of seminal vesicle invasion in prostate cancer patients. Decision curve analysis identified the range of threshold probabilities in which a model was of value, the magnitude of benefit, and which of several models was optimal. Conclusion. Decision curve analysis is a suitable method for evaluating alternative diagnostic and prognostic strategies that has advantages over other commonly used measures and techniques.},

abstract = {Individual participant time-to-event data from multiple prospective epidemiologic studies enable detailed investigation into the predictive ability of risk models. Here we address the challenges in appropriately combining such information across studies. Methods are exemplified by analyses of log C-reactive protein and conventional risk factors for coronary heart disease in the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration, a collation of individual data from multiple prospective studies with an average follow-up duration of 9.8 years (dates varied).We derive risk prediction models using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis stratified by study and obtain estimates of risk discrimination, Harrell's concordance index, and Royston's discrimination measure within each study; we then combine the estimates across studies using aweighted meta-analysis. Various weighting approaches are compared and lead us to recommend using the number of events in each study. We also discuss the calculation of measures of reclassification for multiple studies. We further show that comparison of differences in predictive ability across subgroups should be based only on within-study information and that combining measures of risk discrimination from casecontrol studies and prospective studies is problematic. The concordance index and discrimination measure gave qualitatively similar results throughout. While the concordance index was very heterogeneous between studies, principally because of differing age ranges, the increments in the concordance index from adding log C-reactive protein to conventional risk factors were more homogeneous.},

abstract = {Background: Despite the fact that outreach and early warning systems (EWS) are an integral part of a hospital wide systems approach to improve the early identification and management of deteriorating patients on general hospital wards, the widespread implementation of these interventions in practice is not based on robust research evidence. Objectives: The primary objective was to determine the impact of critical care outreach services on hospital mortality rates. Secondary objectives included determining the effect of outreach services on intensive care unit (ICU) admission patterns, length of hospital stay and adverse events. Search strategy: The review authors searched the following electronic databases: EPOC Specialised Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and other Cochrane databases (all on The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1996-June week 3 2006), EMBASE (1974-week 26 2006), CINAHL (1982-July week 5 2006), First Search (1992-2005) and CAB Health (1990-July 2006); also reference lists of relevant articles, conference abstracts, and made contact with experts and critical care organisations for further information. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), controlled before and after studies (CBAs) and interrupted time series designs (ITS) which measured hospital mortality, unanticipated ICU admissions, ICU readmissions, length of hospital stay and adverse events following implementation of outreach and EWS in a general hospital ward to identify deteriorating adult patients versus general hospital ward setting without outreach and EWS were included in the review. Data collection and analysis: Three review authors independently extracted data and two review authors assessed the methodological quality of the included studies. Meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity. Summary statistics and descriptive summaries of primary and secondary outcomes are presented for each study. Main results: Two cluster-randomised control trials were included: one randomised at hospital level (23 hospitals in Australia) and one at ward level (16 wards in the UK). The primary outcome in the Australian trial (a composite score comprising incidence of unexpected cardiac arrests, unexpected deaths and unplanned ICU admissions) showed no statistical significant difference between control and medical emergency team (MET) hospitals (adjusted P value 0.640; adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.98; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 1.16). The UK-based trial found that outreach reduced in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR 0.52; 95{\%} CI 0.32 to 0.85) compared with the control group. Authors' conclusions: The evidence from this review highlights the diversity and poor methodological quality of most studies investigating outreach. The results of the two included studies showed either no evidence of the effectiveness of outreach or a reduction in overall mortality in patients receiving outreach. The lack of evidence on outreach requires further multi-site RCT's to determine potential effectiveness. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2008 The Cochrane Collaboration.

We prospectively studied 1695 acute medical admissions. All patients were scored in the admissions unit.

Data was compared with an observational study performed in the same unit during the proceeding year. There was no change in mortality of patients with low, intermediate or high Modified Early Warning scores. Rates of cardio-pulmonary arrest, intensive care unit or high dependency unit admission were similar. Data analysis confirmed respiratory rate as the best discriminator in identifying high-risk patient groups. The therapeutic interventions performed in response to abnormal scores were not assessed. We are convinced that the Modified Early Warning score is a suitable scoring tool to identify patients at risk. However, outcomes in medical emergency admissions are influenced by a multitude of factors and so it may be difficult to demonstrate the score's benefit without further standardizing the response to abnormal values.},

abstract = {Background: Acute deterioration in critical ill patients is often preceded by changes in physiological parameters, such as pulse, blood pressure, temperature and respiratory rate. If these changes in the patient's vital parameters are recognized early, excess mortality and serious adverse events (SAEs) such as cardiac arrest may be prevented. The Early Warning Score (EWS) is a scoring system which assists with the detection of physiological changes and may help identify patients at risk of further deterioration. Objectives: The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the impact of the use of the Early Warning Score (EWS) on particular patient outcomes, such as in-hospital mortality, patterns of intensive care unit admission and usage, length of hospital stay, cardiac arrests and other serious adverse events of adult patients on general wards and in medical admission units. Design and setting: Systematic review of studies identified from the bibliographic databases of PubMed, EMBASE.com and The Cochrane Library. Selection criteria: All controlled studies which measured in-hospital mortality, ICU mortality, serious adverse events (SAEs), cardiopulmonary arrest, length of stay and documentation of physiological parameters which used a EWS on the ward or the emergency department to identify patients at risk were included in the review. Data collection and analysis: Three reviewers (NA, AT and EH) independently screened all potentially relevant titles and abstracts for eligibility, by using a standardized data-worksheet. Meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity. Main results: Seven studies met the inclusion criteria. The results of our included studies were mixed, with a positive trend towards better clinical outcomes following the introduction of the EWS chart, sometimes coupled with an outreach service.Six of the seven included studies used mortality as an endpoint: two of these studies reported no significant difference in in-hospital mortality rate; two found a significant reduction of in-hospital mortality; two other studies described a trend towards improved survival. Although, both ICU mortality and serious adverse events were not significantly improved, there was a trend towards reduction of these endpoints after introduction of the EWS. However only two studies looked respectively at each endpoint.There were conflicting results concerning cardiopulmonary arrests. One study found a reduction in the incidence of cardiac arrest calls as well as in the mortality of patients who underwent CPR, while another one found an increased incidence of cardio-pulmonary arrests. Neither study met all methodological quality criteria. Conclusion: The EWS itself is a simple and easy to use tool at the bedside, which may be of help in recognizing patients with potential for acute deterioration. Coupled with an outreach service, it may be used to timely initiate adequate treatment upon recognition, which may influence the clinical outcomes positively. However, the use of adapted forms of the EWS together with different thresholds, poor or inadequate methodology makes it difficult in drawing comparisons. A general conclusion can thus not be generated from the lack of use of a single standardized score and the use of different populations. In future large multi-centre trials using one standardized score are needed also in order to facilitate comparison. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

@article{Austin2017,
abstract = {In survival analysis, a competing risk is an event whose occurrence precludes the occurrence of the primary event of interest. Outcomes in medical research are frequently subject to competing risks. In survival analysis, there are 2 key questions that can be addressed using competing risk regression models: first, which covariates affect the rate at which events occur, and second, which covariates affect the probability of an event occurring over time. The cause-specific hazard model estimates the effect of covariates on the rate at which events occur in subjects who are currently event-free. Subdistribution hazard ratios obtained from the Fine-Gray model describe the relative effect of covariates on the subdistribution hazard function. Hence, the covariates in this model can also be interpreted as having an effect on the cumulative incidence function or on the probability of events occurring over time. We conducted a review of the use and interpretation of the Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard model in articles published in the medical literature in 2015. We found that many authors provided an unclear or incorrect interpretation of the regression coefficients associated with this model. An incorrect and inconsistent interpretation of regression coefficients may lead to confusion when comparing results across different studies. Furthermore, an incorrect interpretation of estimated regression coefficients can result in an incorrect understanding about the magnitude of the association between exposure and the incidence of the outcome. The objective of this article is to clarify how these regression coefficients should be reported and to propose suggestions for interpreting these coefficients.},

abstract = {Objective: To describe the effect of implementation of a rapid response system on the composite endpoint of cardiopulmonary arrest, unplanned ICU admission, or death. Design: Pragmatic prospective Dutch multicenter before-after trial, Cost and Outcomes analysis of Medical Emergency Teams trial. Setting: Twelve hospitals participated, each including two surgical and two nonsurgical wards between April 2009 and November 2011. The Modified Early Warning Score and Situation-Background-Assessment-Recommendation instruments were implemented over 7 months. The rapid response team was then implemented during the following 17 months. The effects of implementing the rapid response team were measured in the last 5 months of this period. Patients: All patients 18 years old and older admitted to the study wards were included. Measurements and Main Results: In total, 166,569 patients were included in the study representing 1,031,172 hospital admission days. No differences were observed in patient demographics between periods. The composite endpoint of cardiopulmonary arrest, unplanned ICU admission, or death per 1,000 admissions was significantly reduced in the rapid response team versus the before phase (adjusted odds ratio, 0.847; 95{\%} CI, 0.725-0.989; p = 0.036). Cardiopulmonary arrests and in-hospital mortality were also significantly reduced (odds ratio, 0.607; 95{\%} CI, 0.393-0.937; p = 0.018 and odds ratio, 0.802; 95{\%} CI, 0.644-1.0; p = 0.05, respectively). Unplanned ICU admissions showed a declining trend (odds ratio, 0.878; 95{\%} CI, 0.755-1.021; p = 0.092), whereas severity of illness at the moment of ICU admission was not different between periods. Conclusions: In this study, introduction of nationwide implementation of rapid response systems was associated with a decrease in the composite endpoint of cardiopulmonary arrests, unplanned ICU admissions, and mortality in patients in general hospital wards. These findings support the implementation of rapid response systems in hospitals to reduce severe adverse events.},

abstract = {Background: Recognizing early signs of clinical deterioration of hospitalized patients is thought to improve patient outcomes by activating more attentive care in a timely fashion. Early warning system scoress are tools used by care teams to potentially predict a patient's risk of deterioration and facilitate changes in management. Objective: To systematically review the evidence on the predictive ability of Early Warning System (EWS) scores and the impact of EWS interventions on health and resource related outcomes. Data Sources: MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library through April 2013 and hand search of reference lists. Study Selection: Independent dual review to identify English language studies of early warning systems tested with adult patients admitted to medical or surgical wards. Non-systematic reviews, opinions, and case series were excluded. Data Extraction: Data were extracted by 2 reviewers on the population, setting, sample size, duration, model discrimination and calibration, health outcomes, and resource utilization. Quality was assessed as applicable using a modified version of the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) assessment tool for observational studies. For predictive ability, primary outcomes were model discrimination on 48-hour mortality, cardiac arrest, or pulmonary arrest. Outcomes for impact of EWS implementation included 30-day mortality, cardiovascular events, use of vasopressors, number of ventilator days, respiratory failure, and resource utilization. Results: Of 13,595 citations reviewed, 17 studies of 11 unique models met criteria. All were based on some combination of vital signs and clinical evaluation. Six observational studies tested in large urban hospitals in developed countries found a strong predictive value for death (AUROC 0.88-0.93) and cardiac arrest (AUROC 0.77-0.86) within 48 hours. Eleven observational cohort studies with historical controls provided evidence on the impact of EWS implementation but were insufficient to draw firm conclusions due to methodological limiitations. Conclusions and Relevance: Current early warning system scores perform well for predicting cardiac arrest and death within 48 hours although the impact on health outcomes and utilization of resources remains uncertain. Efforts to more rigorously assess their performance and effectiveness are needed as use becomes more widespread.},

abstract = {Objectives: The objective of this study was to compare performance of logistic regression (LR) with machine learning (ML) for clinical prediction modeling in the literature. Study Design and Setting: We conducted a Medline literature search (1/2016 to 8/2017) and extracted comparisons between LR and ML models for binary outcomes. Results: We included 71 of 927 studies. The median sample size was 1,250 (range 72–3,994,872), with 19 predictors considered (range 5–563) and eight events per predictor (range 0.3–6,697). The most common ML methods were classification trees, random forests, artificial neural networks, and support vector machines. In 48 (68{\%}) studies, we observed potential bias in the validation procedures. Sixty-four (90{\%}) studies used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to assess discrimination. Calibration was not addressed in 56 (79{\%}) studies. We identified 282 comparisons between an LR and ML model (AUC range, 0.52–0.99). For 145 comparisons at low risk of bias, the difference in logit(AUC) between LR and ML was 0.00 (95{\%} confidence interval, −0.18 to 0.18). For 137 comparisons at high risk of bias, logit(AUC) was 0.34 (0.20–0.47) higher for ML. Conclusion: We found no evidence of superior performance of ML over LR. Improvements in methodology and reporting are needed for studies that compare modeling algorithms.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To document the characteristics and incidence of serious abnormalities in patients prior to admission to intensive care units. DESIGN AND SETTING Prospective follow-up study of all patients admitted to intensive care in three acute-care hospitals. PATIENTS The study population totalled 551 patients admitted to intensive care: 90 from the general ward, 239 from operating rooms (OR) and 222 from the Emergency Department (ED). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS Patients from the general wards had greater severity of illness (APACHE II median 21) than those from the OR (15) or ED (19). A greater percentage of patients from the general wards (47.6{\%}) died than from OR (19.3{\%}) and ED (31.5{\%}). Patients from the general wards had a greater number of serious antecedents before admission to intensive care 43 (72{\%}) than those from OR 150 (64.4{\%}) or ED 126 (61.8{\%}). Of the 551 patients 62 had antecedents during the period 8-48 h before admission to intensive care, and 53 had antecedents both within 8 and 48 h before their admission. The most common antecedents during the 8 h before admission were hypotension (n=199), tachycardia (n=73), tachypnoea (n=64), and sudden change in level of consciousness (n=42). Concern was expressed in the clinical notes by attending staff in 70{\%} of patients admitted from the general wards. CONCLUSIONS In over 60{\%} of patients admitted to intensive care potentially life-threatening abnormalities were documented during the 8 h before their admission. This may represent a patient population who could benefit from improved resuscitation and care at an earlier stage.},

abstract = {Aims: To determine whether cardiac arrest calls, the proportion of adult patients admitted to intensive care after CPR and their associated mortalities were reduced, in a four year period after the introduction of a 24/7 Critical Care Outreach Service and MEWS (Modified Early Warning System) Charts. Methods: A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data during two four-year periods, (2002-05 and 2006-09) in a UK University Teaching Hospital Comparisons were via $\chi$2 test. A p value of ≤0.05 was regarded as being significant. Results: In the second audit period, compared to the first one, the number of cardiac arrest calls relative to adult hospital admissions decreased significantly (0.2{\%} vs. 0.4{\%}; p{\textless} 0.0001), the proportion of patients admitted to intensive care having undergone in-hospital CPR fell significantly (2{\%} vs. 3{\%}; p= 0.004) as did the in-hospital mortality of these patients (42{\%} vs. 52{\%}; p= 0.05). Conclusion: The four years following the introduction of a 24/7 Critical Care Outreach Service and MEWS Charts were associated with significant reductions in the incidence of cardiac arrest calls, the proportion of patients admitted to intensive care having undergone in-hospital CPR and their in-hospital mortality. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

Implementations of routines to incorporate observations with incomplete variables in regression models are now widely available. We review these routines in the context of a motivating example from a large health services research dataset. While there are still limitations to the current implementations, and additional efforts are required of the analyst, it is feasible to incorporate partially observed values, and these methods should be used in practice. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Statisticial Association.},

abstract = {Joint models for longitudinal and survival data have gained a lot of attention in recent years, with the development of myriad extensions to the basic model, including those which allow for multivariate longitudinal data, competing risks and recurrent events. Several software packages are now also available for their implementation. Although mathematically straightforward, the inclusion of multiple longitudinal outcomes in the joint model remains computationally difficult due to the large number of random effects required, which hampers the practical application of this extension. We present a novel approach that enables the fitting of such models with more realistic computational times. The idea behind the approach is to split the estimation of the joint model in two steps: estimating a multivariate mixed model for the longitudinal outcomes and then using the output from this model to fit the survival submodel. So-called two-stage approaches have previously been proposed and shown to be biased. Our approach differs from the standard version, in that we additionally propose the application of a correction factor, adjusting the estimates obtained such that they more closely resemble those we would expect to find with the multivariate joint model. This correction is based on importance sampling ideas. Simulation studies show that this corrected two-stage approach works satisfactorily, eliminating the bias while maintaining substantial improvement in computational time, even in more difficult settings.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Early intervention and response to deranged physiological parameters in the critically ill patient improves outcomes. A National Early Warning Score (NEWS) based on physiological observations has been developed for use throughout the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK. Although a good predictor of mortality and deterioration in inpatients, its performance in the prehospital setting is largely untested. This study aimed to assess the validity of the NEWS in unselected prehospital patients. METHODS All clinical observations taken by emergency ambulance crews transporting patients to a single hospital were collated along with information relating to hospital outcome over a two month period. The performance of the NEWS in identifying the endpoints of 48h and 30 day mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and a combined endpoint of 48h mortality or ICU admission was analysed. RESULTS 1684 patients were analysed. All three of the primary endpoints and the combined endpoint were associated with higher NEWS scores (p{\textless}0.01 for each). The medium-risk NEWS group was associated with a statistically significant increase in ICU admission (RR=2.466, 95{\%} CI 1.0-6.09), but not in-hospital mortality relative to the low risk group. The high risk NEWS group had significant increases in 48h mortality (RR 35.32 [10.08-123.7]), 30 day mortality (RR 6.7 [3.79-11.88]), and ICU admission (5.43 [2.29-12.89]). Similar results were noted when trauma and non-trauma patients were analysed separately. CONCLUSIONS Elevated NEWS among unselected prehospital patients is associated with a higher incidence of adverse outcomes. Calculation of prehospital NEWS may facilitate earlier recognition of deteriorating patients, early involvement of senior Emergency Department staff and appropriate critical care.},

@article{VanCalster2016,
abstract = {Objective Calibrated risk models are vital for valid decision support. We define four levels of calibration and describe implications for model development and external validation of predictions. Study Design and Setting We present results based on simulated data sets. Results A common definition of calibration is "having an event rate of R{\%} among patients with a predicted risk of R{\%}," which we refer to as "moderate calibration." Weaker forms of calibration only require the average predicted risk (mean calibration) or the average prediction effects (weak calibration) to be correct. "Strong calibration" requires that the event rate equals the predicted risk for every covariate pattern. This implies that the model is fully correct for the validation setting. We argue that this is unrealistic: the model type may be incorrect, the linear predictor is only asymptotically unbiased, and all nonlinear and interaction effects should be correctly modeled. In addition, we prove that moderate calibration guarantees nonharmful decision making. Finally, results indicate that a flexible assessment of calibration in small validation data sets is problematic. Conclusion Strong calibration is desirable for individualized decision support but unrealistic and counter productive by stimulating the development of overly complex models. Model development and external validation should focus on moderate calibration.},

abstract = {Background: Prognostic models often show poor performance when applied to independent validation data sets. We illustrate how treatment use in a validation set can affect measures of model performance and present the uses and limitations of available analytical methods to account for this using simulated data. Methods: We outline how the use of risk-lowering treatments in a validation set can lead to an apparent overestimation of risk by a prognostic model that was developed in a treatment-na{\"{i}}ve cohort to make predictions of risk without treatment. Potential methods to correct for the effects of treatment use when testing or validating a prognostic model are discussed from a theoretical perspective. Subsequently, we assess, in simulated data sets, the impact of excluding treated individuals and the use of inverse probability weighting (IPW) on the estimated model discrimination (c-index) and calibration (observed:expected ratio and calibration plots) in scenarios with different patterns and effects of treatment use. Results: Ignoring the use of effective treatments in a validation data set leads to poorer model discrimination and calibration than would be observed in the untreated target population for the model. Excluding treated individuals provided correct estimates of model performance only when treatment was randomly allocated, although this reduced the precision of the estimates. IPW followed by exclusion of the treated individuals provided correct estimates of model performance in data sets where treatment use was either random or moderately associated with an individual's risk when the assumptions of IPW were met, but yielded incorrect estimates in the presence of non-positivity or an unobserved confounder. Conclusions: When validating a prognostic model developed to make predictions of risk without treatment, treatment use in the validation set can bias estimates of the performance of the model in future targeted individuals, and should not be ignored. When treatment use is random, treated individuals can be excluded from the analysis. When treatment use is non-random, IPW followed by the exclusion of treated individuals is recommended, however, this method is sensitive to violations of its assumptions.},

Although sound theory is lacking, variable selection is a popular statistical method which seemingly reduces the complexity of such models. However, in fact, variable selection often complicates analysis as it invalidates common tools of statistical inference such as P-values and confidence intervals. This is a particular problem in transplantation research where sample sizes are often only small to moderate. Furthermore, variable selection requires computer-intensive stability investigations and a particularly cautious interpretation of results. We discuss how five common misconceptions often lead to inappropriate application of variable selection. We emphasize that variable selection and all problems related with it can often be avoided by the use of expert knowledge.},

@article{Vickers2016,
abstract = {Many decisions in medicine involve trade-offs, such as between diagnosing patients with disease versus unnecessary additional testing for those who are healthy. Net benefit is an increasingly reported decision analytic measure that puts benefits and harms on the same scale. This is achieved by specifying an exchange rate, a clinical judgment of the relative value of benefits (such as detecting a cancer) and harms (such as unnecessary biopsy) associated with models, markers, and tests. The exchange rate can be derived by asking simple questions, such as the maximum number of patients a doctor would recommend for biopsy to find one cancer. As the answers to these sorts of questions are subjective, it is possible to plot net benefit for a range of reasonable exchange rates in a "decision curve." For clinical prediction models, the exchange rate is related to the probability threshold to determine whether a patient is classified as being positive or negative for a disease. Net benefit is useful for determining whether basing clinical decisions on a model, marker, or test would do more good than harm. This is in contrast to traditional measures such as sensitivity, specificity, or area under the curve, which are statistical abstractions not directly informative about clinical value. Recent years have seen an increase in practical applications of net benefit analysis to research data. This is a welcome development, since decision analytic techniques are of particular value when the purpose of a model, marker, or test is to help doctors make better clinical decisions.},

@article{Hickey2016,
abstract = {Background: Available methods for the joint modelling of longitudinal and time-to-event outcomes have typically only allowed for a single longitudinal outcome and a solitary event time. In practice, clinical studies are likely to record multiple longitudinal outcomes. Incorporating all sources of data will improve the predictive capability of any model and lead to more informative inferences for the purpose of medical decision-making. Methods: We reviewed current methodologies of joint modelling for time-to-event data and multivariate longitudinal data including the distributional and modelling assumptions, the association structures, estimation approaches, software tools for implementation and clinical applications of the methodologies. Results: We found that a large number of different models have recently been proposed. Most considered jointly modelling linear mixed models with proportional hazard models, with correlation between multiple longitudinal outcomes accounted for through multivariate normally distributed random effects. So-called current value and random effects parameterisations are commonly used to link the models. Despite developments, software is still lacking, which has translated into limited uptake by medical researchers. Conclusion: Although, in an era of personalized medicine, the value of multivariate joint modelling has been established, researchers are currently limited in their ability to fit these models routinely. We make a series of recommendations for future research needs.},

abstract = {Objective: In diagnostic accuracy studies, the reference standard may be imperfect or not available in all patients. We systematically reviewed the proposed solutions for these situations and generated methodological guidance. Study Design and Setting: Review of methodological articles. Results: We categorized the solutions into four main groups. The first group includes methods that impute or adjust for missing data on the reference standard. The second group consists of methods that correct estimates of accuracy obtained with an imperfect reference standard. In the third group a reference standard is constructed by combining multiple test results through a predefined rule, based on a consensus procedure, or through statistical modeling. In the fourth group, the diagnostic accuracy paradigm is abandoned in favor of validation studies that relate index test results to relevant clinical data, such as history, future clinical events, and response to therapy. Conclusion: Most of the methods try to impute, adjust, or construct a reference standard. In situations that deviate only marginally from the classical diagnostic accuracy paradigm, these are valuable methods. In cases where an acceptable reference standard does not exist, the concept of clinical test validation may provide an alternative paradigm to evaluate a diagnostic test. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

@article{DAgostino2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND - Separate multivariable risk algorithms are commonly used to assess risk of specific atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, ie, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, and heart failure. The present report presents a single multivariable risk function that predicts risk of developing all CVD and of its constituents. METHODS AND RESULTS - We used Cox proportional-hazards regression to evaluate the risk of developing a first CVD event in 8491 Framingham study participants (mean age, 49 years; 4522 women) who attended a routine examination between 30 and 74 years of age and were free of CVD. Sex-specific multivariable risk functions ("general CVD" algorithms) were derived that incorporated age, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, treatment for hypertension, smoking, and diabetes status. We assessed the performance of the general CVD algorithms for predicting individual CVD events (coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, or heart failure). Over 12 years of follow-up, 1174 participants (456 women) developed a first CVD event. All traditional risk factors evaluated predicted CVD risk (multivariable-adjusted P{\textless}0.0001). The general CVD algorithm demonstrated good discrimination (C statistic, 0.763 [men] and 0.793 [women]) and calibration. Simple adjustments to the general CVD risk algorithms allowed estimation of the risks of each CVD component. Two simple risk scores are presented, 1 based on all traditional risk factors and the other based on non-laboratory-based predictors. CONCLUSIONS - A sex-specific multivariable risk factor algorithm can be conveniently used to assess general CVD risk and risk of individual CVD events (coronary, cerebrovascular, and peripheral arterial disease and heart failure). The estimated absolute CVD event rates can be used to quantify risk and to guide preventive care. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Heart Association, Inc.},

abstract = {Electronic health records (EHRs) present a wealth of data that are vital for improving patient-centered outcomes, although the data can present significant statistical challenges. In particular, EHR data contains substantial missing information that if left unaddressed could reduce the validity of conclusions drawn. Properly addressing the missing data issue in EHR data is complicated by the fact that it is sometimes difficult to differentiate between missing data and a negative value. For example, a patient without a documented history of heart failure may truly not have disease or the clinician may have simply not documented the condition. Approaches for reducing missing data in EHR systems come from multiple angles, including: increasing structured data documentation, reducing data input errors, and utilization of text parsing / natural language processing. This paper focuses on the analytical approaches for handling missing data, primarily multiple imputation. The broad range of variables available in typical EHR systems provide a wealth of information for mitigating potential biases caused by missing data. The probability of missing data may be linked to disease severity and healthcare utilization since unhealthier patients are more likely to have comorbidities and each interaction with the health care system provides an opportunity for documentation. Therefore, any imputation routine should include predictor variables that assess overall health status (e.g. Charlson Comorbidity Index) and healthcare utilization (e.g. number of encounters) even when these comorbidities and patient encounters are unrelated to the disease of interest. Linking the EHR data with other sources of information (e.g. National Death Index and census data) can also provide less biased variables for imputation. Additional methodological research with EHR data and improved epidemiological training of clinical investigators is warranted.},

abstract = {A risk prediction model is a statistical tool for estimating the probability that a currently healthy individual with specific risk factors will develop a condition in the future such as breast cancer. Reliably accurate prediction models can inform future disease burdens, health policies and individual decisions. Breast cancer prediction models containing modifiable risk factors, such as alcohol consumption, BMI or weight, condom use, exogenous hormone use and physical activity, are of particular interest to women who might be considering how to reduce their risk of breast cancer and clinicians developing health policies to reduce population incidence rates. We performed a systematic review to identify and evaluate the performance of prediction models for breast cancer that contain modifiable factors. A protocol was developed and a sensitive search in databases including MEDLINE and EMBASE was conducted in June 2010. Extensive use was made of reference lists. Included were any articles proposing or validating a breast cancer prediction model in a general female population, with no language restrictions. Duplicate data extraction and quality assessment were conducted. Results were summarised qualitatively, and where possible meta-analysis of model performance statistics was undertaken. The systematic review found 17 breast cancer models, each containing a different but often overlapping set of modifiable and other risk factors, combined with an estimated baseline risk that was also often different. Quality of reporting was generally poor, with characteristics of included participants and fitted model results often missing. Only four models received independent validation in external data, most notably the 'Gail 2' model with 12 validations. None of the models demonstrated consistently outstanding ability to accurately discriminate between those who did and those who did not develop breast cancer. For example, random-effects meta-analyses of the performance of the 'Gail 2' model showed the average C statistic was 0.63 (95{\%} CI 0.59-0.67), and the expected/observed ratio of events varied considerably across studies (95{\%} prediction interval for E/O ratio when the model was applied in practice was 0.75-1.19). There is a need for models with better predictive performance but, given the large amount of work already conducted, further improvement of existing models based on conventional risk factors is perhaps unlikely. Research to identify new risk factors with large additionally predictive ability is therefore needed, alongside clearer reporting and continual validation of new models as they develop.},

abstract = {When machine learning algorithms are applied to data collected during the course of clinical care, it is generally accepted that the data has not been consistently collected. The absence of expected data elements is common and the mechanism through which a data element is missing often involves the clinical relevance of that data element in a specific patient. Therefore, the absence of data may have information value of its own. In the process of designing an application intended to support a medical problem list, we have studied whether the "missingness" of clinical data can provide useful information in building prediction models. In this study, we experimented with four methods of treating missing values in a clinical data set-two of them explicitly model the absence or "missingness" of data. Each of these data sets were used to build four different kinds of Bayesian classifiers-a naive Bayes structure, a human-composed network structure, and two networks based on structural learning algorithms. We compared the performance between groups with and without explicit models of missingness using the area under the ROC curve. The results showed that in most cases the classifiers trained using the explicit missing value treatments performed better. The result suggests that information may exist in "missingness" itself. Thus, when designing a decision support system, we suggest one consider explicitly representing the presence/absence of data in the underlying logic. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Objectives: This review aims to: 1) evaluate the quality of model reporting, 2) provide an overview of methodology for developing and validating Early Warning Score Systems (EWSs) for adult patients in acute care settings, and 3) highlight the strengths and limitations of the methodologies, as well as identify future directions for EWS derivation and validation studies. Methodology: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL. Only peer reviewed articles and clinical guidelines regarding developing and validating EWSs for adult patients in acute care settings were included. 615 articles were extracted and reviewed by five of the authors. Selected studies were evaluated based on the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) checklist. The studies were analyzed according to their study design, predictor selection, outcome measurement, methodology of modeling, and validation strategy. Results: A total of 29 articles were included in the final analysis. Twenty-six articles reported on the development and validation of a new EWS, while three reported on validation and model modification. Only eight studies met more than 75{\%} of the items in the TRIPOD checklist. Three major techniques were utilized among the studies to inform their predictive algorithms: 1) clinical-consensus models (n = 6), 2) regression models (n = 15), and 3) tree models (n = 5). The number of predictors included in the EWSs varied from 3 to 72 with a median of seven. Twenty-eight models included vital signs, while 11 included lab data. Pulse oximetry, mental status, and other variables extracted from electronic health records (EHRs) were among other frequently used predictors. In-hospital mortality, unplanned transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU), and cardiac arrest were commonly used clinical outcomes. Twenty-eight studies conducted a form of model validation either within the study or against other widely-used EWSs. Only three studies validated their model using an external database separate from the derived database. Conclusion: This literature review demonstrates that the characteristics of the cohort, predictors, and outcome selection, as well as the metrics for model validation, vary greatly across EWS studies. There is no consensus on the optimal strategy for developing such algorithms since data-driven models with acceptable predictive accuracy are often site-specific. A standardized checklist for clinical prediction model reporting exists, but few studies have included reporting aligned with it in their publications. Data-driven models are subjected to biases in the use of EHR data, thus it is particularly important to provide detailed study protocols and acknowledge, leverage, or reduce potential biases of the data used for EWS development to improve transparency and generalizability.},

abstract = {Statistical models support medical research by facilitating individualized outcome prognostication conditional on independent variables or by estimating effects of risk factors adjusted for covariates. Theory of statistical models is well-established if the set of independent variables to consider is fixed and small. Hence, we can assume that effect estimates are unbiased and the usual methods for confidence interval estimation are valid. In routine work, however, it is not known a priori which covariates should be included in a model, and often we are confronted with the number of candidate variables in the range 10-30. This number is often too large to be considered in a statistical model. We provide an overview of various available variable selection methods that are based on significance or information criteria, penalized likelihood, the change-in-estimate criterion, background knowledge, or combinations thereof. These methods were usually developed in the context of a linear regression model and then transferred to more generalized linear models or models for censored survival data. Variable selection, in particular if used in explanatory modeling where effect estimates are of central interest, can compromise stability of a final model, unbiasedness of regression coefficients, and validity of p-values or confidence intervals. Therefore, we give pragmatic recommendations for the practicing statistician on application of variable selection methods in general (low-dimensional) modeling problems and on performing stability investigations and inference. We also propose some quantities based on resampling the entire variable selection process to be routinely reported by software packages offering automated variable selection algorithms.

Categorising continuous measurements into two or more categories has been widely discredited, yet is still frequently done because of its simplicity, investigator ignorance of the potential impact and of suitable alternatives, or to facilitate model uptake. We examine three broad approaches for handling continuous predictors on the performance of a prognostic model, including various methods of categorising predictors, modelling a linear relationship between the predictor and outcome and modelling a nonlinear relationship using fractional polynomials or restricted cubic splines. We compare the performance (measured by the c-index, calibration and net benefit) of prognostic models built using each approach, evaluating them using separate data from that used to build them. We show that categorising continuous predictors produces models with poor predictive performance and poor clinical usefulness. Categorising continuous predictors is unnecessary, biologically implausible and inefficient and should not be used in prognostic model development. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors.

abstract = {This aim of this study was to assess the impact of the introduction of a standardised early warning scoring system (SEWS) on physiological observations and patient outcomes in unselected acute admissions at point of entry to care. A sequential clinical audit was performed on 848 patients admitted to a combined medical and surgical assessment unit during two separate 11-day periods. Physiological parameters (respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and conscious level), in-hospital mortality, length of stay, transfer to critical care and staff satisfaction were documented. Documentation of these physiological parameters improved (P{\textless}0.001-0.005) with the exception of oxygen saturation (P=0.069). The admission early warning score correlated both with in-hospital mortality (P{\textless}0.001) and length of stay (P=0.001). Following the introduction of the scoring system, inpatient mortality decreased (P=0.046). Staff responding to a questionnaire indicated that the scoring system increased awareness of illness severity (80{\%}) and prompted earlier interventions (60{\%}). A standardised early warning scoring system improves documentation of physiological parameters, correlates with in-hospital mortality, and helps predict length of stay.},

@article{Hogan2012,
abstract = {Introduction: Monitoring hospital mortality rates is widely recommended. However, the number of preventable deaths remains uncertain with estimates in England ranging from 840 to 40 000 per year, these being derived from studies that identified adverse events but not whether events contributed to death or shortened life expectancy of those affected. Methods: Retrospective case record reviews of 1000 adults who died in 2009 in 10 acute hospitals in England were undertaken. Trained physician reviewers estimated life expectancy on admission, to identified problems in care contributing to death and judged if deaths were preventable taking into account patients' overall condition at that time. Results: Reviewers judged 5.2{\%} (95{\%} CI 3.8{\%} to 6.6{\%}) of deaths as having a 50{\%} or greater chance of being preventable. The principal problems associated with preventable deaths were poor clinical monitoring (31.3{\%}; 95{\%} CI 23.9 to 39.7), diagnostic errors (29.7{\%}; 95{\%} CI 22.5{\%} to 38.1{\%}), and inadequate drug or fluid management (21.1{\%}; 95{\%} CI 14.9 to 29.0). Extrapolating from these figures suggests there would have been 11 859 (95{\%} CI 8712 to 14 983) adult preventable deaths in hospitals in England. Most preventable deaths (60{\%}) occurred in elderly, frail patients with multiple comorbidities judged to have had less than 1 year of life left to live. Conclusions: The incidence of preventable hospital deaths is much lower than previous estimates. The burden of harm from preventable problems in care is still substantial. A focus on deaths may not be the most efficient approach to identify opportunities for improvement given the low proportion of deaths due to problems with healthcare.},

@article{Corfield2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND An important element in improving the care of patients with sepsis is early identification and early intervention. Early warning score (EWS) systems allow earlier identification of physiological deterioration. A standardised national EWS (NEWS) has been proposed for use across the National Health Service in the UK. AIM To determine whether a single NEWS on emergency department (ED) arrival is a predictor of outcome, either in-hospital death within 30 days or intensive care unit (ICU) admission within 2 days, in patients with sepsis. METHODS Data were collected over a 3-month period as part of a national audit in 20 EDs in Scotland. All adult patients who were admitted for at least 2 days or who died within 2 days were screened for sepsis criteria. Patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria were included. An EWS was calculated based on initial physiological observations made in the ED using the NEWS. RESULTS Complete data were available for 2003 patients. Each rise in NEWS category was associated with an increased risk of mortality when compared to the lowest category (5-6: OR 1.95, 95{\%} CI 1.21 to 3.14), (7-8: OR 2.26, 95{\%} CI 1.42 to 3.61), (9-20: OR 5.64, 95{\%} CI 3.70 to 8.60). This was also the case for the combined outcome (ICU and/or mortality). CONCLUSIONS An increased NEWS on arrival at ED is associated with higher odds of adverse outcome among patients with sepsis. The use of NEWS could facilitate patient pathways to ensure triage to a high acuity area of the ED and senior clinician involvement at an early stage.},

abstract = {Introduction Several versions of Early Warning Systems (EWS) are used in obstetrics to detect and treat early clinical deterioration to avert morbidity and mortality. EWS can potentially be useful to improve the quality of care and reduce the risk of maternal mortality in resource-limited settings. We conducted a systematic literature review of published obstetric early warning systems, define their predictive accuracy for morbidity and mortality, and their effectiveness in triggering corrective actions and improving health outcomes. Methods We systematically searched for primary research articles on obstetric EWS published in peer-reviewed journals between January 1997 and March 2018 in Medline, CINAHL, SCOPUS, Science Direct, and Science Citation Index. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles and websites of professional societies. We included studies that assessed the predictive accuracy of EWS to detect clinical deterioration, or/and their effectiveness in improving clinical outcomes in obstetric inpatients. We excluded studies with a paediatric or non-obstetric adult population. Cross-sectional and qualitative studies were also excluded. We performed a narrative synthesis since the outcomes reported were heterogeneous. Results A total of 381 papers were identified, 17 of which met the inclusion criteria. Eleven of the included studies evaluated the predictive accuracy of EWS for obstetric morbidity and mortality, 5 studies assessed the effectiveness of EWS in improving clinical outcomes, while one study addressed both. Sixteen published EWS versions were reviewed, 14 of which included five basic clinical observations (pulse rate, respiratory rate, temperature, blood pressure, and consciousness level). The obstetric EWS identified had very high median (inter-quartile range) sensitivity-89{\%} (72{\%} to 97{\%}) and specificity-85{\%} (67{\%} to 98{\%}) but low median (inter-quartile range) positive predictive values-41{\%} (25{\%} to 74{\%}) for predicting morbidity or ICU admission. Obstetric EWS had a very high accuracy in predicting death (AUROC {\textgreater}0.80) among critically ill obstetric patients. Obstetric EWS improves the frequency of routine vital sign observation, reduces the interval between the recording of specifically defined abnormal clinical observations and corrective clinical actions, and can potentially reduce the severity of obstetric morbidity. Conclusion Obstetric EWS are effective in predicting severe morbidity (in general obstetric population) and mortality (in critically ill obstetric patients). EWS can contribute to improved quality of care, prevent progressive obstetric morbidity and improve health outcomes. There is limited evidence of the effectiveness of EWS in reducing maternal death across all settings. Clinical parameters in most obstetric EWS versions are routinely collected in resource-limited settings, therefore implementing EWS may be feasible in such settings.},

abstract = {Objectives To develop and validate updated QRISK3 prediction algorithms to estimate the 10 year risk of cardiovascular disease in women and men accounting for potential new risk factors. Design Prospective open cohort study. Setting General practices in England providing data for the QResearch database. Participants 1309 QResearch general practices in England: 981 practices were used to develop the scores and a separate set of 328 practices were used to validate the scores. 7.89 million patients aged 25-84 years were in the derivation cohort and 2.67 million patients in the validation cohort. Patients were free of cardiovascular disease and not prescribed statins at baseline. Methods Cox proportional hazards models in the derivation cohort to derive separate risk equations in men and women for evaluation at 10 years. Risk factors considered included those already in QRISK2 (age, ethnicity, deprivation, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, total cholesterol: high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, smoking, family history of coronary heart disease in a first degree relative aged less than 60 years, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, treated hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease (stage 4 or 5)) and new risk factors (chronic kidney disease (stage 3, 4, or 5), a measure of systolic blood pressure variability (standard deviation of repeated measures), migraine, corticosteroids, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), atypical antipsychotics, severe mental illness, and HIV/AIDS). We also considered erectile dysfunction diagnosis or treatment in men. Measures of calibration and discrimination were determined in the validation cohort for men and women separately and for individual subgroups by age group, ethnicity, and baseline disease status. Main outcome measures Incident cardiovascular disease recorded on any of the following three linked data sources: general practice, mortality, or hospital admission records. Results 363 565 incident cases of cardiovascular disease were identified in the derivation cohort during follow-up arising from 50.8 million person years of observation. All new risk factors considered met the model inclusion criteria except for HIV/AIDS, which was not statistically significant. The models had good calibration and high levels of explained variation and discrimination. In women, the algorithm explained 59.6{\%} of the variation in time to diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (R 2, with higher values indicating more variation), and the D statistic was 2.48 and Harrell's C statistic was 0.88 (both measures of discrimination, with higher values indicating better discrimination). The corresponding values for men were 54.8{\%}, 2.26, and 0.86. Overall performance of the updated QRISK3 algorithms was similar to the QRISK2 algorithms. Conclusion Updated QRISK3 risk prediction models were developed and validated. The inclusion of additional clinical variables in QRISK3 (chronic kidney disease, a measure of systolic blood pressure variability (standard deviation of repeated measures), migraine, corticosteroids, SLE, atypical antipsychotics, severe mental illness, and erectile dysfunction) can help enable doctors to identify those at most risk of heart disease and stroke.},

abstract = {Background: Comorbidity adjustment is an important component of health services research and clinical prognosis. When adjusting for comorbidities in statistical models, researchers can include comorbidities individually or through the use of summary measures such as the Charlson Comorbidity Index or Elixhauser score. We examined the conditions under which individual versus summary measures are most appropriate. Methods: We provide an analytic proof of the utility of comorbidity summary measures when used in place of individual comorbidities. We compared the use of the Charlson and Elixhauser scores versus individual comorbidities in prognostic models using a SEER-Medicare data example. We examined the ability of summary comorbidity measures to adjust for confounding using simulations. Results: We devised a mathematical proof that found that the comorbidity summary measures are appropriate prognostic or adjustment mechanisms in survival analyses. Once one knows the comorbidity score, no other information about the comorbidity variables used to create the score is generally needed. Our data example and simulations largely confirmed this finding. Conclusions: Summary comorbidity measures, such as the Charlson Comorbidity Index and Elixhauser scores, are commonly used for clinical prognosis and comorbidity adjustment. We have provided a theoretical justification that validates the use of such scores under many conditions. Our simulations generally confirm the utility of the summary comorbidity measures as substitutes for use of the individual comorbidity variables in health services research. One caveat is that a summary measure may only be as good as the variables used to create it.},

abstract = {Objectives: To understand factors associated with errors using an established paper-based early warning score (EWS) system. We investigated the types of error, where they are most likely to occur, and whether 'errors' can predict subsequent changes in patient vital signs. Methods: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected early warning system database from a single large UK teaching hospital. Results: 16 795 observation sets, from 200 postsurgical patients, were collected. Incomplete observation sets were more likely to contain observations which should have led to an alert than complete observation sets (15.1{\%} vs 7.6{\%}, p{\textless}0.001), but less likely to have an alerting score correctly calculated (38.8{\%} vs 30.0{\%}, p{\textless}0.001). Mis-scoring was much more common when leaving a sequence of three or more consecutive observation sets with aggregate scores of 0 (55.3{\%}) than within the sequence (3.0{\%}, p{\textless}0.001). Observation sets that 'incorrectly' alerted were more frequently followed by a correctly alerting observation set than error-free nonalerting observation sets (14.7{\%} vs 4.2{\%}, p{\textless}0.001). Observation sets that 'incorrectly' did not alert were more frequently followed by an observation set that did not alert than error-free alerting observation sets (73.2{\%} vs 45.8{\%}, p{\textless}0.001). Conclusions: Missed alerts are particularly common in incomplete observation sets and when a patient first becomes unstable. Observation sets that 'incorrectly' alert or 'incorrectly' do not alert are highly predictive of the next observation set, suggesting that clinical staff detect both deterioration and improvement in advance of the EWS system by using information not currently encoded within it. Work is urgently needed to understand how best to capture this information.},

abstract = {Background: On South African public hospital wards, observation charts do not incorporate early warning scoring (EWS) systems to inform nurses when to summon assistance. The aim of this trial was to test the impact of a new chart incorporating a modified EWS (MEWS) system and a linked training program on nurses' responses to clinical deterioration (primary outcome). Secondary outcomes were: numbers of patients with vital signs recordings in the first eight postoperative hours; number of times each vital sign was recorded; and nurses' knowledge. Methods/design: A pragmatic, parallel-group, cluster randomized, controlled clinical trial of intervention versus standard care was conducted in three intervention and three control adult surgical wards in an 867-bed public hospital in Cape Town, between March and July 2010; thereafter the MEWS chart was withdrawn. A total of 50 out of 122 nurses in full-time employment participated. From 1,427 case notes, 114 were selected by randomization for assessment. Results: Patients in trial arms were similar. Introduction of the MEWS was not associated with statistically significant changes in responses to clinical deterioration (50 of 57 received no assistance versus 55 of 57, odds ratio (OR): 0.26, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.05 to 1.31), despite improvement in nurses' knowledge in intervention wards. More patients in intervention than control wards had recordings of respiratory rate (27 of 57 versus 2 of 57, OR: 24.75, 95{\%} CI: 5.5 to 111.3) and recordings of all seven parameters (5 of 57 versus 0 of 57 patients, risk estimate: 1.10, 95{\%} CI: 1.01 to 1.2). Conclusions: A MEWS chart and training program enhanced recording of respiratory rate and of all parameters, and nurses' knowledge, but not nurses' responses to patients who triggered the MEWS reporting algorithm.},

This type of research question has given rise to a rapidly developing field of biostatistics research that deals with the joint modeling of longitudinal and time-to-event data. In this article, we consider this modeling framework and focus particularly on the assessment of the predictive ability of the longitudinal marker for the time-to-event outcome. In particular, we start by presenting how survival probabilities can be estimated for future subjects based on their available longitudinal measurements and a fitted joint model. Following we derive accuracy measures under the joint modeling framework and assess how well the marker is capable of discriminating between subjects who experience the event within a medically meaningful time frame from subjects who do not. We illustrate our proposals on a real data set on human immunodeficiency virus infected patients for which we are interested in predicting the time-to-death using their longitudinal CD4 cell count measurements. {\textcopyright} 2011, The International Biometric Society.},

abstract = {Various performance measures related to calibration and discrimination are available for the assessment of risk models. When the validity of a risk model is assessed in a new population, estimates of the model's performance can be influenced in several ways. The regression coefficients can be incorrect, which indeed results in an invalid model. However, the distribution of patient characteristics (case mix) may also influence the performance of the model. Here the authors consider a number of typical situations that can be encountered in external validation studies. Theoretical relations between differences in development and validation samples and performance measures are studied by simulation. Benchmark values for the performance measures are proposed to disentangle a case-mix effect from incorrect regression coefficients, when interpreting the model's estimated performance in validation samples. The authors demonstrate the use of the benchmark values using data on traumatic brain injury obtained from the International Tirilazad Trial and the North American Tirilazad Trial (1991-1994). {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author.},

abstract = {Uveitis is characterised as a recurrent inflammation of the eye and an ongoing inflammation can have severe impact on the visual acuity of the patient. The Rotterdam Eye Hospital has been collecting data on every uveitis patient visiting the hospital since 2000. We propose a joint model for the inflammation and visual acuity with the purpose of making dynamic predictions. Dynamic prediction models allow predictions to be updated during the follow-up of the patient based on the patient's disease history. The joint model consists of a submodel for the inflammation, the event history outcome, and one for the visual acuity, the longitudinal outcome. The inflammation process is described with a two-state reversible multistate model, where transition times are interval censored. Correlated log-normal frailties are included in the multistate model to account for the within eye and within patient correlation. A linear mixed model is used for the visual acuity. The joint model is fitted in a two-stage procedure and we illustrate how the model can be used to make dynamic predictions. The performance of the method was investigated in a simulation study. The novelty of the proposed model includes the extension to a multistate outcome, whereas, previously, the standard has been to consider survival or competing risk outcomes. Furthermore, it is usually the case that the longitudinal outcome affects the event history outcome, but in this model, the relation is reversed.},

@article{Brangan2018,
abstract = {OBJECTIVES Early warning scores were developed to improve recognition of clinical deterioration in acute hospital settings. In England, the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) is increasingly being recommended at a national level for use outside such settings. In 2015, the West of England Academic Health Science Network supported the roll-out of NEWS across a range of non-acute-hospital healthcare sectors. Research on the use of NEWS outside acute hospitals is limited. The objective of this study was to explore staff experiences of using NEWS in these new settings. DESIGN Thematic analysis of qualitative semi-structured interviews with purposefully sampled healthcare staff. SETTING West of England healthcare settings where NEWS was being used outside acute hospitals-primary care, ambulance, referral management, community and mental health services. PARTICIPANTS Twenty-five healthcare staff interviewed from primary care (9), ambulance (3), referral management/acute interface (5), community (4) and mental health services (3), and service commissioning (1). RESULTS Participants reported that NEWS could support clinical decision-making around escalation of care, and provide a clear means of communicating clinical acuity between clinicians and across different healthcare organisations. Challenges with implementing NEWS varied-in primary care, clinicians had to select patients for NEWS and adopt different methods of clinical assessment, whereas for paramedics it fitted well with usual clinical practice and was used for all patients. In community services and mental health, modifications were 'needed' to make the tool relevant to some patient populations. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated that while NEWS can work for staff outside acute hospital settings, the potential for routine clinical practice to accommodate NEWS in such settings varied. A tailored approach to implementation in different settings, incorporating guidance supported by further research on the use of NEWS with specific patient groups in community settings, may be beneficial, and enhance staff confidence in the tool.},

@book{Steyerberg2009,
abstract = {This book provides insight and practical illustrations on how modern statistical concepts and regression methods can be applied in medical prediction problems, including diagnostic and prognostic outcomes. Many advances have been made in statistical approaches towards outcome prediction, but these innovations are insufficiently applied in medical research. Old-fashioned, data hungry methods are often used in data sets of limited size, validation of predictions is not done or done simplistically, and updating of previously developed models is not considered. A sensible strategy is needed for model development, validation, and updating, such that prediction models can better support medical practice. Clinical prediction models presents a practical checklist with seven steps that need to be considered for development of a valid prediction model. These include preliminary considerations such as dealing with missing values; coding of predictors; selection of main effects and interactions for a multivariable model; estimation of model parameters with shrinkage methods and incorporation of external data; evaluation of performance and usefulness; internal validation; and presentation formats. The steps are illustrated with many small case-studies and R code, with data sets made available in the public domain. The book further focuses on generalizability of prediction models, including patterns of invalidity that may be encountered in new settings, approaches to updating of a model, and comparisons of centers after case-mix adjustment by a prediction model. The text is primarily intended for clinical epidemiologists and biostatisticians. It can be used as a textbook for a graduate course on predictive modeling in diagnosis and prognosis. It is beneficial if readers are familiar with common statistical models in medicine: linear regression, logistic regression, and Cox regression. The book is practical in nature. But it provides a philosophical perspective on data analysis in medicine that goes beyond predictive modeling. In this era of evidence-based medicine, randomized clinical trials are the basis for assessment of treatment efficacy. Prediction models are key to individualizing diagnostic and treatment decision making. Ewout Steyerberg (1967) is Professor of Medical Decision Making, in particular prognostic modeling, at Erasmus MC-University Medical Center Rotterdam, the Netherlands. His work on prediction models was stimulated by various research grants including a fellowship from the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. He has published over 250 peer-reviewed articles in collaboration with many clinical researchers, both in methodological and medical journals.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability world-wide. The ability to accurately predict patient outcome after TBI has an important role in clinical practice and research. Prognostic models are statistical models that combine two or more items of patient data to predict clinical outcome. They may improve predictions in TBI patients. Multiple prognostic models for TBI have accumulated for decades but none of them is widely used in clinical practice. The objective of this systematic review is to critically assess existing prognostic models for TBI METHODS: Studies that combine at least two variables to predict any outcome in patients with TBI were searched in PUBMED and EMBASE. Two reviewers independently examined titles, abstracts and assessed whether each met the pre-defined inclusion criteria. RESULTS A total of 53 reports including 102 models were identified. Almost half (47{\%}) were derived from adult patients. Three quarters of the models included less than 500 patients. Most of the models (93{\%}) were from high income countries populations. Logistic regression was the most common analytical strategy to derived models (47{\%}). In relation to the quality of the derivation models (n:66), only 15{\%} reported less than 10{\%} pf loss to follow-up, 68{\%} did not justify the rationale to include the predictors, 11{\%} conducted an external validation and only 19{\%} of the logistic models presented the results in a clinically user-friendly way CONCLUSION Prognostic models are frequently published but they are developed from small samples of patients, their methodological quality is poor and they are rarely validated on external populations. Furthermore, they are not clinically practical as they are not presented to physicians in a user-friendly way. Finally because only a few are developed using populations from low and middle income countries, where most of trauma occurs, the generalizability to these setting is limited.},

Results The number of emergency admissions (YH: 35584; NH: 35795), mortality (YH: 5.7{\%}; NH: 5.5{\%}), index NEWS (YH: 2.5; NH: 2.1) and numbers of NEWS recorded (YH: 879193; NH: 884072) were similar in each hospital. The mean number of patients with medium level alerts per day increased from 55.3 (NEWS) to 69.5 (NEWS2), a 25.7{\%} increase in YH and 64.1 (NEWS) to 77.4 (NEWS2), a 20.7{\%} increase in NH. The mean number of patients with high level alerts per day increased from 27.3 (NEWS) to 34.4 (NEWS2), a 26.0{\%} increase in YH and 29.9 (NEWS) to 37.7 (NEWS2), a 26.1{\%} increase in NH. Conclusions The addition of delirium in NEWS2 will have a substantial increase in medium and high level alerts in hospitalised emergency medical patients. Rigorous evaluation of NEWS2 is required before widespread implementation because the extent to which staff can cope with this increase without adverse consequences remains unknown.},

abstract = {The prediction of outcomes in patients at Clinical High Risk for Psychosis (CHR-P) almost exclusively relies on static data obtained at a single snapshot in time (ie, baseline data). Although the CHR-P symptoms are intrinsically evolving over time, available prediction models cannot be dynamically updated to reflect these changes. Hence, the aim of this study was to develop and internally validate a dynamic risk prediction model (joint model) and to implement this model in a user-friendly online risk calculator. Furthermore, we aimed to explore the prognostic performance of extended dynamic risk prediction models and to compare static with dynamic prediction. One hundred ninety-six CHR-P patients were recruited as part of the "Basel Fr{\"{u}}herkennung von Psychosen" (FePsy) study. Psychopathology and transition to psychosis was assessed at regular intervals for up to 5 years using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale-Expanded (BPRS-E). Various specifications of joint models were compared with regard to their cross-validated prognostic performance. We developed and internally validated a joint model that predicts psychosis onset from BPRS-E disorganization and years of education at baseline and BPRS-E positive symptoms during the follow-up with good prognostic performance. The model was implemented as online risk calculator (http://www.fepsy.ch/DPRP/). The use of extended joint models slightly increased the prognostic accuracy compared to basic joint models, and dynamic models showed a higher prognostic accuracy than static models. Our results confirm that extended joint modeling could improve the prediction of psychosis in CHR-P patients. We implemented the first online risk calculator that can dynamically update psychosis risk prediction.},

abstract = {Background and Objectives: The performance of a prediction model is usually worse in external validation data compared to the development data. We aimed to determine at which effective sample sizes (i.e., number of events) relevant differences in model performance can be detected with adequate power. Methods: We used a logistic regression model to predict the probability that residual masses of patients treated for metastatic testicular cancer contained only benign tissue. We performed standard power calculations and Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the numbers of events that are required to detect several types of model invalidity with 80{\%} power at the 5{\%} significance level. Results: A validation sample with 111 events was required to detect that a model predicted too high probabilities, when predictions were on average 1.5 times too high on the odds scale. A decrease in discriminative ability of the model, indicated by a decrease in the c-statistic from 0.83 to 0.73, required 81 to 106 events, depending on the specific scenario. Conclusion: We suggest a minimum of 100 events and 100 nonevents for external validation samples. Specific hypotheses may, however, require substantially higher effective sample sizes to obtain adequate power. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Background: Clinical prediction models are often constructed using multicenter databases. Such a data structure poses additional challenges for statistical analysis (clustered data) but offers opportunities for model generalizability to a broad range of centers. The purpose of this study was to describe properties, analysis, and reporting of multicenter studies in the Tufts PACE Clinical Prediction Model Registry and to illustrate consequences of common design and analyses choices. Methods: Fifty randomly selected studies that are included in the Tufts registry as multicenter and published after 2000 underwent full-text screening. Simulated examples illustrate some key concepts relevant to multicenter prediction research. Results: Multicenter studies differed widely in the number of participating centers (range 2 to 5473). Thirty-nine of 50 studies ignored the multicenter nature of data in the statistical analysis. In the others, clustering was resolved by developing the model on only one center, using mixed effects or stratified regression, or by using center-level characteristics as predictors. Twenty-three of 50 studies did not describe the clinical settings or type of centers from which data was obtained. Four of 50 studies discussed neither generalizability nor external validity of the developed model. Conclusions: Regression methods and validation strategies tailored to multicenter studies are underutilized. Reporting on generalizability and potential external validity of the model lacks transparency. Hence, multicenter prediction research has untapped potential.

abstract = {Background: Ten events per variable (EPV) is a widely advocated minimal criterion for sample size considerations in logistic regression analysis. Of three previous simulation studies that examined this minimal EPV criterion only one supports the use of a minimum of 10 EPV. In this paper, we examine the reasons for substantial differences between these extensive simulation studies. Methods: The current study uses Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate small sample bias, coverage of confidence intervals and mean square error of logit coefficients. Logistic regression models fitted by maximum likelihood and a modified estimation procedure, known as Firth's correction, are compared. Results: The results show that besides EPV, the problems associated with low EPV depend on other factors such as the total sample size. It is also demonstrated that simulation results can be dominated by even a few simulated data sets for which the prediction of the outcome by the covariates is perfect (‘separation'). We reveal that different approaches for identifying and handling separation leads to substantially different simulation results. We further show that Firth's correction can be used to improve the accuracy of regression coefficients and alleviate the problems associated with separation. Conclusions: The current evidence supporting EPV rules for binary logistic regression is weak. Given our findings, there is an urgent need for new research to provide guidance for supporting sample size considerations for binary logistic regression analysis.},

@article{Cuthbertson2007,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Early warning scoring systems are widely used in clinical practice to allow early recognition of the deteriorating patient, but they lack validation. We aimed to test the ability of physiologic variables, either alone or in existing early scoring systems, to predict major deterioration in a patient's condition and attempt to derive functions with superior accuracy. DESIGN: A comparative cohort study. SETTING: A teaching hospital in Scotland. PATIENTS: Two cohorts of general surgical high-dependency patients. The cohorts are a group of surgical high-dependency care patients who did not require intensive care admission and another group of patients who did require admission. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Prospective physiologic data on consecutive surgical high-dependency unit patients were collected and compared with physiologic data on patients admitted to the intensive care unit from the same surgical high-dependency units. Data were quality checked and summarized, and discriminant analysis and receiver operator curves were used to discriminate between the groups. There were significant physiologic differences between groups with regard to heart rate (p {\textless} .001, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] 0.7), respiratory rate (p {\textless} .001, AUC 0.71), and oxygen saturation (p {\textless} .001, AUC 0.78) across time points. This was not present for systolic blood pressure or temperature. Existing early warning scoring systems had good discriminatory power (AUC 0.83-0.86). We derived discriminant functions, which have a high predictive ability to determine differences between groups (p {\textless} .0001, AUC 0.86-0.90). We found that heart rate and respiratory rate could detect differences between groups at 6 and 8 hrs before ICU admission, but oxygen saturation and the discriminant function 2 could detect differences 48 hrs before ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: Some commonly used physiologic variables have reasonable power in determining the difference between patients requiring intensive care unit admission, but others are poor. Existing early warning scores have comparatively good discriminatory power. We have derived functions with excellent predictive power in this derivation cohort.

abstract = {Background: Older people are increasing users of health care globally. We aimed to establish whether older people with characteristics of frailty and who are at risk of adverse health-care outcomes could be identified using routinely collected data. Methods: A three-step approach was used to develop and validate a Hospital Frailty Risk Score from International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnostic codes. First, we carried out a cluster analysis to identify a group of older people (≥75 years) admitted to hospital who had high resource use and diagnoses associated with frailty. Second, we created a Hospital Frailty Risk Score based on ICD-10 codes that characterised this group. Third, in separate cohorts, we tested how well the score predicted adverse outcomes and whether it identified similar groups as other frailty tools. Findings: In the development cohort (n=22 139), older people with frailty diagnoses formed a distinct group and had higher non-elective hospital use (33{\textperiodcentered}6 bed-days over 2 years compared with 23{\textperiodcentered}0 bed-days for the group with the next highest number of bed-days). In the national validation cohort (n=1 013 590), compared with the 429 762 (42{\textperiodcentered}4{\%}) patients with the lowest risk scores, the 202 718 (20{\textperiodcentered}0{\%}) patients with the highest Hospital Frailty Risk Scores had increased odds of 30-day mortality (odds ratio 1{\textperiodcentered}71, 95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}68–1{\textperiodcentered}75), long hospital stay (6{\textperiodcentered}03, 5{\textperiodcentered}92–6{\textperiodcentered}10), and 30-day readmission (1{\textperiodcentered}48, 1{\textperiodcentered}46–1{\textperiodcentered}50). The c statistics (ie, model discrimination) between individuals for these three outcomes were 0{\textperiodcentered}60, 0{\textperiodcentered}68, and 0{\textperiodcentered}56, respectively. The Hospital Frailty Risk Score showed fair overlap with dichotomised Fried and Rockwood scales (kappa scores 0{\textperiodcentered}22, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}15–0{\textperiodcentered}30 and 0{\textperiodcentered}30, 0{\textperiodcentered}22–0{\textperiodcentered}38, respectively) and moderate agreement with the Rockwood Frailty Index (Pearson's correlation coefficient 0{\textperiodcentered}41, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}38–0{\textperiodcentered}47). Interpretation: The Hospital Frailty Risk Score provides hospitals and health systems with a low-cost, systematic way to screen for frailty and identify a group of patients who are at greater risk of adverse outcomes and for whom a frailty-attuned approach might be useful.

abstract = {Background: Nurses' recognition of clinical deterioration is crucial for patient survival. Evidence for the effectiveness of modified early warning scores (MEWS) is derived from large observation studies in developed countries. Methods: We tested the effectiveness of the paper-based Cape Town (CT) MEWS vital signs observation chart and situation-background-assessment-recommendation (SBAR) communication guide. Outcomes were: proportion of appropriate responses to deterioration, differences in recording of clinical parameters and serious adverse events (SAEs) in intervention and control trial arms. Public teaching hospitals for adult patients in Cape Town were randomised to implementation of the CT MEWS/SBAR guide or usual care (observation chart without track-and-trigger information) for 31 days on general medical and surgical wards. Nurses in intervention wards received training, as they had no prior knowledge of early warning systems. Identification and reporting of patient deterioration in intervention and control wards were compared. In the intervention arm, 24 day-shift and 23 night-shift nurses received training. Clinical records were reviewed retrospectively at trial end. Only records of patients who had given signed consent were reviewed. Results: We recruited two of six CT general hospitals. We consented 363 patients and analysed 292 (80.4{\%}) patient records (n = 150, 51.4{\%} intervention, n = 142, 48.6{\%} control arm). Assistance was summoned for fewer patients with abnormal vital signs in the intervention arm (2/45, 4.4{\%} versus (vs) 11/81, 13.6{\%}, OR 0.29 (0.06-1.39)), particularly low systolic blood pressure. There was a significant difference in recording between trial arms for parameters listed on the MEWS chart but omitted from the standard observations chart: oxygen saturation, level of consciousness, pallor/cyanosis, pain, sweating, wound oozing, pedal pulses, glucose concentration, haemoglobin concentration, and "looks unwell". SBAR was used twice. There was no statistically significant difference in SAEs (5/150, 3.3{\%} vs 3/143, 2.1{\%} P = 0.72, OR 1.61 (0.38-6.86)). Conclusions: The revised CT MEWS observations chart improved recording of certain parameters, but did not improve nurses' ability to identify early signs of clinical deterioration and to summon assistance. Recruitment of only two hospitals and exclusion of patients too ill to consent limits generalisation of results. Further work is needed on educational preparation for the CT MEWS/SBAR and its impact on nurses' reporting behaviour. Trial registration: Pan African Clinical Trials Registry, PACTR201406000838118.

abstract = {In medical research, continuous variables are often converted into categorical variables by grouping values into two or more categories. We consider in detail issues pertaining to creating just two groups, a common approach in clinical research. We argue that the simplicity achieved is gained at a cost; dichotomization may create rather than avoid problems, notably a considerable loss of power and residual confounding. In addition, the use of a data-derived 'optimal' cutpoint leads to serious bias. We illustrate the impact of dichotomization of continuous predictor variables using as a detailed case study a randomized trial in primary biliary cirrhosis. Dichotomization of continuous data is unnecessary for statistical analysis and in particular should not be applied to explanatory variables in regression models.

abstract = {Background: Patients with cardiac arrests or who die in general wards have often received delayed or inadequate care. We investigated whether the medical emergency team (MET) system could reduce the incidence of cardiac arrests, unplanned admissions to intensive care units (ICU), and deaths. Methods: We randomised 23 hospitals in Australia to continue functioning as usual (n=11) or to introduce a MET system (n=12). The primary outcome was the composite of cardiac arrest, unexpected death, or unplanned ICU admission during the 6-month study period after MET activation. Analysis was by intention to treat. Findings: Introduction of the MET increased the overall calling incidence for an emergency team (3.1 vs 8.7 per 1000 admissions, p=0.0001). The MET was called to 30{\%} of patients who fulfilled the calling criteria and who were subsequently admitted to the ICU. During the study, we recorded similar incidence of the composite primary outcome in the control and MET hospitals (5.86 vs 5.31 per 1000 admissions, p=0.640), as well as of the individual secondary outcomes (cardiac arrests, 1.64 vs 1.31, p=0.736; unplanned ICU admissions, 4.68 vs 4.19, p=0.599; and unexpected deaths, 1.18 vs 1.06, p=0.752). A reduction in the rate of cardiac arrests (p=0.003) and unexpected deaths (p=0.01) was seen from baseline to the study period for both groups combined. Interpretation: The MET system greatly increases emergency team calling, but does not substantially affect the incidence of cardiac arrest, unplanned ICU admissions, or unexpected death.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND As part of an interdisciplinary study of medical injury and malpractice litigation, we estimated the incidence of adverse events, defined as injuries caused by medical management, and of the subgroup of such injuries that resulted from negligent or substandard care. METHODS We reviewed 30,121 randomly selected records from 51 randomly selected acute care, nonpsychiatric hospitals in New York State in 1984. We then developed population estimates of injuries and computed rates according to the age and sex of the patients as well as the specialties of the physicians. RESULTS Adverse events occurred in 3.7 percent of the hospitalizations (95 percent confidence interval, 3.2 to 4.2), and 27.6 percent of the adverse events were due to negligence (95 percent confidence interval, 22.5 to 32.6). Although 70.5 percent of the adverse events gave rise to disability lasting less than six months, 2.6 percent caused permanently disabling injuries and 13.6 percent led to death. The percentage of adverse events attributable to negligence increased in the categories of more severe injuries (Wald test chi 2 = 21.04, P less than 0.0001). Using weighted totals, we estimated that among the 2,671,863 patients discharged from New York hospitals in 1984 there were 98,609 adverse events and 27,179 adverse events involving negligence. Rates of adverse events rose with age (P less than 0.0001). The percentage of adverse events due to negligence was markedly higher among the elderly (P less than 0.01). There were significant differences in rates of adverse events among categories of clinical specialties (P less than 0.0001), but no differences in the percentage due to negligence. CONCLUSIONS There is a substantial amount of injury to patients from medical management, and many injuries are the result of substandard care.},

abstract = {Mixture models capture heterogeneity in data by decomposing the population into latent subgroups, each of which is governed by its own subgroup-specific set of parameters. Despite the flexibility and widespread use of these models, most applications have focused solely on making inferences for whole or subpopulations, rather than individual cases. This article presents a general framework for computing marginal and conditional predicted values for individuals using mixture model results. These predicted values can be used to characterize covariate effects, examine the fit of the model for specific individuals, or forecast future observations from previous ones. Two empirical examples are provided to demonstrate the usefulness of individual predicted values in applications of mixture models. The first example examines the relative timing of initiation of substance use using a multiple event process survival mixture model, whereas the second example evaluates changes in depressive symptoms over adolescence using a growth mixture model.},

abstract = {Missing data are much studied in epidemiology and statistics. Theoretical development and application of methods for handling missing data have mostly been conducted in the context of prospective research data and with a goal of description or causal explanation. However, it is now common to build predictive models using routinely collected data, where missing patterns may convey important information, and one might take a pragmatic approach to optimizing prediction. Therefore, different methods to handle missing data may be preferred. Furthermore, an underappreciated issue in prediction modeling is that the missing data method used in model development may not match the method used when a model is deployed. This may lead to overoptimistic assessments of model performance. For prediction, particularly with routinely collected data, methods for handling missing data that incorporate information within the missingness pattern should be explored and further developed. Where missing data methods differ between model development and model deployment, the implications of this must be explicitly evaluated. The trade-off between building a prediction model that is causally principled, and building a prediction model that maximizes the use of all available information, should be carefully considered and will depend on the intended use of the model.},

abstract = {A standardised early warning system must be usable and utilised in all settings

Currently, hospitals across England don't use a standardised early warning system (EWS) to identify patients at risk of deterioration or sepsis, or in need of intervention. No other safety critical industry would tolerate this. The NHS has evolved into tribes who use different dialects to describe sickness.

Whatever the system, it must be usable and utilised in all settings. A score in one setting must mean the same in any other. Although doctors rarely use EWS when communicating with each other regarding a patient, they provide a safety mechanism to make sure that nurses flag up deteriorating patients on the ward, and that patients are prioritised based on their mortality risk. {\ldots}},

abstract = {A standardised early warning system must be usable and utilised in all settings Currently, hospitals across England don't use a standardised early warning system (EWS) to identify patients at risk of deterioration or sepsis, or in need of intervention. No other safety critical industry would tolerate this. The NHS has evolved into tribes who use different dialects to describe sickness. Whatever the system, it must be usable and utilised in all settings. A score in one setting must mean the same in any other. Although doctors rarely use EWS when communicating with each other regarding a patient, they provide a safety mechanism to make sure that nurses flag up deteriorating patients on the ward, and that patients are prioritised based on their mortality risk. {\ldots}},

@article{Pepe2013,
abstract = {Authors have proposed new methodology in recent years for evaluating the improvement in prediction performance gained by adding a new predictor, Y, to a risk model containing a set of baseline predictors, X, for a binary outcome D. We prove theoretically that null hypotheses concerning no improvement in performance are equivalent to the simple null hypothesis that Y is not a risk factor when controlling for X, H0: P(D=1|X,Y)=P(D=1|X). Therefore, testing for improvement in prediction performance is redundant if Y has already been shown to be a risk factor. We also investigate properties of tests through simulation studies, focusing on the change in the area under the ROC curve (AUC). An unexpected finding is that standard testing procedures that do not adjust for variability in estimated regression coefficients are extremely conservative. This may explain why the AUC is widely considered insensitive to improvements in prediction performance and suggests that the problem of insensitivity has to do with use of invalid procedures for inference rather than with the measure itself. To avoid redundant testing and use of potentially problematic methods for inference, we recommend that hypothesis testing for no improvement be limited to evaluation of Y as a risk factor, for which methods are well developed and widely available. Analyses of measures of prediction performance should focus on estimation rather than on testing for no improvement in performance. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Clinical deterioration of ward patients can result in intensive care unit (ICU) transfer, cardiac arrest (CA), and/or death. These different outcomes have been used to develop and test track and trigger systems, but the impact of outcome selection on the performance of prediction algorithms is unknown. METHODS Patients hospitalized on the wards between November 2008 and August 2011 at an academic hospital were included in the study. Ward vital signs and demographic characteristics were compared across outcomes. The dataset was then split into derivation and validation cohorts. Logistic regression was used to derive four models (one per outcome and a combined outcome) for predicting each event within 24h of a vital sign set. The models were compared in the validation cohort using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS A total of 59,643 patients were included in the study (including 109 ward CAs, 291 deaths, and 2638 ICU transfers). Most mean vital signs within 24h of the events differed statistically, with those before death being the most deranged. Validation model AUCs were highest for predicting mortality (range 0.73–0.82), followed by CA (range 0.74–0.76), and lowest for predicting ICU transfer (range 0.68–0.71). CONCLUSIONS Despite differences in vital signs before CA, ICU transfer, and death, the different models performed similarly for detecting each outcome. Mortality was the easiest outcome to predict and ICU transfer the most difficult. Studies should be interpreted with these differences in mind.},

abstract = {Multivariable fractional polynomial (MFP) models are commonly used in medical research. The datasets in which MFP models are applied often contain covariates with missing values. To handle the missing values, we describe methods for combining multiple imputation with MFP modelling, considering in turn three issues: first, how to impute so that the imputation model does not favour certain fractional polynomial (FP) models over others; second, how to estimate the FP exponents in multiply imputed data; and third, how to choose between models of differing complexity. Two imputation methods are outlined for different settings. For model selection, methods based on Wald-type statistics and weighted likelihood-ratio tests are proposed and evaluated in simulation studies. The Wald-based method is very slightly better at estimating FP exponents. Type I error rates are very similar for both methods, although slightly less well controlled than analysis of complete records; however, there is potential for substantial gains in power over the analysis of complete records. We illustrate the two methods in a dataset from five trauma registries for which a prognostic model has previously been published, contrasting the selected models with that obtained by analysing the complete records only. {\textcopyright} 2015 The Authors.

abstract = {Objectives: To calculate fractional inspired oxygen concentration (FiO2) thresholds in ward patients and add these to the National Early Warning Score (NEWS). To evaluate the performance of NEWS-FiO2 against NEWS when predicting in-hospital death and unplanned intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Methods: A multi-centre, retrospective, observational cohort study was carried out in five hospitals from two UK NHS Trusts. Adult admissions with at least one complete set of vital sign observations recorded electronically were eligible. The primary outcome measure was an ‘adverse event' which comprised either in-hospital death or unplanned ICU admission. Discrimination was assessed using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC). Results: A cohort of 83,304 patients from a total of 271,363 adult admissions were prescribed oxygen. In this cohort, NEWS-FiO2 (AUROC 0.823, 95{\%} CI 0.819–0.824) outperformed NEWS (AUORC 0.811, 95{\%} CI 0.809–0.814) when predicting in-hospital death or unplanned ICU admission within 24 h of a complete set of vital sign observations. Conclusions: NEWS-FiO2 generates a performance gain over NEWS when studied in ward patients requiring oxygen. This warrants further study, particularly in patients with respiratory disorders.},

abstract = {Applications of modern methods for analyzing data with missing values, based primarily on multiple imputation, have in the last half-decade become common in American politics and political behavior. Scholars in this subset of political science have thus increasingly avoided the biases and inefficiencies caused by ad hoc methods like listwise deletion and best guess imputation. However, researchers in much of comparative politics and international relations, and others with similar data, have been unable to do the same because the best available imputation methods work poorly with the time-series cross-section data structures common in these fields. We attempt to rectify this situation with three related developments. First, we build a multiple imputation model that allows smooth time trends, shifts across cross-sectional units, and correlations over time and space, resulting in far more accurate imputations. Second, we enable analysts to incorporate knowledge from area studies experts via priors on individual missing cell values, rather than on difficult-to-interpret model parameters. Third, because these tasks could not be accomplished within existing imputation algorithms, in that they cannot handle as many variables as needed even in the simpler cross-sectional data for which they were designed, we also develop a new algorithm that substantially expands the range of computationally feasible data types and sizes for which multiple imputation can be used. These developments also make it possible to implement the methods introduced here in freely available open source software that is considerably more reliable than existing algorithms. {\textcopyright}2010, Midwest Political Science Association.},

abstract = {Binary logistic regression is one of the most frequently applied statistical approaches for developing clinical prediction models. Developers of such models often rely on an Events Per Variable criterion (EPV), notably EPV ≥10, to determine the minimal sample size required and the maximum number of candidate predictors that can be examined. We present an extensive simulation study in which we studied the influence of EPV, events fraction, number of candidate predictors, the correlations and distributions of candidate predictor variables, area under the ROC curve, and predictor effects on out-of-sample predictive performance of prediction models. The out-of-sample performance (calibration, discrimination and probability prediction error) of developed prediction models was studied before and after regression shrinkage and variable selection. The results indicate that EPV does not have a strong relation with metrics of predictive performance, and is not an appropriate criterion for (binary) prediction model development studies. We show that out-of-sample predictive performance can better be approximated by considering the number of predictors, the total sample size and the events fraction. We propose that the development of new sample size criteria for prediction models should be based on these three parameters, and provide suggestions for improving sample size determination.},

abstract = {Paediatric Early Warning Scores (PEWS)are used in hospitalised patients to detect physiological deterioration and is being used increasingly throughout healthcare systems with a limited evidence based. There are two versions in general use that can lead to a clinical response, either by triggering an action or by reaching a ' threshold' when graduated responses may occur depending on the value of the score. Most evidence has come from research based on paediatric inpatients in specialist children's hospitals, although the range of research is expanding, taking into account other clinical areas such as paediatric intensive care unit, emergency department and the prehospital setting. Currrently, it is uncertain whether a unified system does deliver benefits in terms of outcomes or financial savings, but it may inform and improve patient communication. PEWS may be an additional tool in context of a patient's specific condition, and future work will include its validation for different conditions, different clinical settings, patient populations and organisational structure. The incorporation of PEWS within the electronic health records may form a keystone of the safe system framework and allow the development of consistent PEWS system to standardise practice.},

abstract = {Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited, chronic, progressive condition affecting around 10,000 individuals in the United Kingdom and over 70,000 worldwide. Survival in CF has improved considerably over recent decades, and it is important to provide up-to-date information on patient prognosis. Methods: The UK Cystic Fibrosis Registry is a secure centralized database, which collects annual data on almost all CF patients in the United Kingdom. Data from 43,592 annual records from 2005 to 2015 on 6181 individuals were used to develop a dynamic survival prediction model that provides personalized estimates of survival probabilities given a patient's current health status using 16 predictors. We developed the model using the landmarking approach, giving predicted survival curves up to 10 years from 18 to 50 years of age. We compared several models using cross-validation. Results: The final model has good discrimination (C-indexes: 0.873, 0.843, and 0.804 for 2-, 5-, and 10-year survival prediction) and low prediction error (Brier scores: 0.036, 0.076, and 0.133). It identifies individuals at low and high risk of short- and long-term mortality based on their current status. For patients 20 years of age during 2013-2015, for example, over 80{\%} had a greater than 95{\%} probability of 2-year survival and 40{\%} were predicted to survive 10 years or more. Conclusions: Dynamic personalized prediction models can guide treatment decisions and provide personalized information for patients. Our application illustrates the utility of the landmarking approach for making the best use of longitudinal and survival data and shows how models can be defined and compared in terms of predictive performance.},

abstract = {Risk models that aim to predict the future course and outcome of disease processes are increasingly used in health research, and it is important that they are accurate and reliable. Most of these risk models are fitted using routinely collected data in hospitals or general practices. Clinical outcomes such as short-term mortality will be near-complete, but many of the predictors may have missing values. A common approach to dealing with this is to perform a complete-case analysis. However, this may lead to overfitted models and biased estimates if entire patient subgroups are excluded. The aim of this paper is to investigate a number of methods for imputing missing data to evaluate their effect on risk model estimation and the reliability of the predictions. Multiple imputation methods, including hotdecking and multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE), were investigated along with several single imputation methods. A large national cardiac surgery database was used to create simulated yet realistic datasets. The results suggest that complete case analysis may produce unreliable risk predictions and should be avoided. Conditional mean imputation performed well in our scenario, but may not be appropriate if using variable selection methods. MICE was amongst the best performing multiple imputation methods with regards to the quality of the predictions. Additionally, it produced the least biased estimates, with good coverage, and hence is recommended for use in practice.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. SUMMARY The relationship between a response variable and one or more continuous covariates is often curved. Attempts to represent curvature in single-or multiple-regression models are usually made by means of polynomials of the covariates, typically quadratics. However, low order polynomials offer a limited family of shapes, and high order polynomials may fit poorly at the extreme values of the covariates. We propose an extended family of curves, which we call fractional polynomials, whose power terms are restricted to a small predefined set of integer and non-integer values. The powers are selected so that conventional polynomials are a subset of the family. Regression models using fractional polynomials of the covariates have appeared in the literature in an ad hoc fashion over a long period; we provide a unified description and a degree of formalization for them. They are shown to have considerable flexibility and are straightforward to fit using standard methods. We suggest an iterative algorithm for covariate selection and model fitting when several covariates are available. We give six examples of the use of fractional polynomial models in three types of regression analysis: normal errors, logistic and Cox regression. The examples all relate to medical data: fetal measurements, immunoglobulin concentrations in children, diabetes in children, infertility in women, myelomatosis (a type of leukaemia) and leg ulcers.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND We investigated the reporting and methods of prediction studies, focusing on aims, designs, participant selection, outcomes, predictors, statistical power, statistical methods, and predictive performance measures. METHODS AND FINDINGS We used a full hand search to identify all prediction studies published in 2008 in six high impact general medical journals. We developed a comprehensive item list to systematically score conduct and reporting of the studies, based on recent recommendations for prediction research. Two reviewers independently scored the studies. We retrieved 71 papers for full text review: 51 were predictor finding studies, 14 were prediction model development studies, three addressed an external validation of a previously developed model, and three reported on a model's impact on participant outcome. Study design was unclear in 15{\%} of studies, and a prospective cohort was used in most studies (60{\%}). Descriptions of the participants and definitions of predictor and outcome were generally good. Despite many recommendations against doing so, continuous predictors were often dichotomized (32{\%} of studies). The number of events per predictor as a measure of statistical power could not be determined in 67{\%} of the studies; of the remainder, 53{\%} had fewer than the commonly recommended value of ten events per predictor. Methods for a priori selection of candidate predictors were described in most studies (68{\%}). A substantial number of studies relied on a p-value cut-off of p{\textless}0.05 to select predictors in the multivariable analyses (29{\%}). Predictive model performance measures, i.e., calibration and discrimination, were reported in 12{\%} and 27{\%} of studies, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The majority of prediction studies in high impact journals do not follow current methodological recommendations, limiting their reliability and applicability.},

abstract = {The area under the time-dependent ROC curve (AUC) may be used to quantify the ability of a marker to predict the onset of a clinical outcome in the future. For survival analysis with competing risks, two alternative definitions of the specificity may be proposed depending of the way to deal with subjects who undergo the competing events. In this work, we propose nonparametric inverse probability of censoring weighting estimators of the AUC corresponding to these two definitions, and we study their asymptotic properties. We derive confidence intervals and test statistics for the equality of the AUCs obtained with two markers measured on the same subjects. A simulation study is performed to investigate the finite sample behaviour of the test and the confidence intervals. The method is applied to the French cohort PAQUID to compare the abilities of two psychometric tests to predict dementia onset in the elderly accounting for death without dementia competing risk. The 'timeROC' R package is provided to make the methodology easily usable. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Peek2007,
abstract = {Objective: To investigate the behavior of predictive performance measures that are commonly used in external validation of prognostic models for outcome at intensive care units (ICUs). Study Design and Setting: Four prognostic models (Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, and the Mortality Probability Models II) were evaluated in the Dutch National Intensive Care Evaluation registry database. For each model discrimination (AUC), accuracy (Brier score), and two calibration measures were assessed on data from 41,239 ICU admissions. This validation procedure was repeated with smaller subsamples randomly drawn from the database, and the results were compared with those obtained on the entire data set. Results: Differences in performance between the models were small. The AUC and Brier score showed large variation with small samples. Standard errors of AUC values were accurate but the power to detect differences in performance was low. Calibration tests were extremely sensitive to sample size. Direct comparison of performance, without statistical analysis, was unreliable with either measure. Conclusion: Substantial sample sizes are required for performance assessment and model comparison in external validation. Calibration statistics and significance tests should not be used in these settings. Instead, a simple customization method to repair lack-of-fit problems is recommended. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The median sample size was 1,250 (range 72–3,994,872), with 19 predictors considered (range 5–563) and eight events per predictor (range 0.3–6,697). The most common ML methods were classification trees, random forests, artificial neural networks, and support vector machines. In 48 (68{\%}) studies, we observed potential bias in the validation procedures. Sixty-four (90{\%}) studies used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to assess discrimination. Calibration was not addressed in 56 (79{\%}) studies. We identified 282 comparisons between an LR and ML model (AUC range, 0.52–0.99). For 145 comparisons at low risk of bias, the difference in logit(AUC) between LR and ML was 0.00 (95{\%} confidence interval, −0.18 to 0.18).
