Early warning scores (EWSs) are tools used by hospital staff to monitor the health status of patients, and identify those at risk of deterioration.
They are used extensively around the world.
Historically they were implemented as part of paper-based observation charts, and were therefore simple tools.
More recently vital signs are increasingly documented using electronic systems, allowing for more sophisticated EWSs to be introduced.

I carried out a systematic review to assess the methodological quality of previous studies which have developed or validated EWSs.
The review highlighted a number of common deficiencies.
All studies were found to be at high risk of bias.

Using the HAVEN data set which included approximately four years' worth of data from the Oxford University Hospitals Trust, I investigated some of the underlying hypotheses of EWSs (and the vital sign data they rely upon).
Most current EWSs do not account a patient's age, however I found that there are large differences in the normal ranges of most vital signs across the age spectrum, most notably in the case of blood pressure and oxygen saturation.
I also examined the assumption underlying EWSs, which is that vital signs become increasingly abnormal as a patient deteriorates.
By assessing the distribution of vital signs over the four days prior to hospital discharge, ICU admission, and death, I was able to observe that the majority of vital signs do become abnormal over the previous 24-48 hours for those patients who went to ICU or died.

The data used in EWS research is more complex than traditional prediction modelling studies because each patient may contribute multiple sets of measurements.
How best to use this clustered data is not clear, and a number of different approaches are seen in previous studies.
Using a simulation study, I was able to identify the best approach, and this was what I used going forward.

External validation of the most commonly used EWS (NEWS) revealed that its predictive performance varied considerably depending on the patient's illness, the ward they were on, and their age.
It was difficult to discern any particular pattern underlying the illness/ward heterogeneity that would identify factors which should be included in a new model.
However, it was clear that a patient's age should be accounted for.

I developed a new age-specific EWS, which separately predicts ICU admission and death.
By using age by vital sign interactions I enabled the predictive power of each vital sign to vary according to the age of the patient.
This model showed substantial improvements in performance compared to NEWS.
